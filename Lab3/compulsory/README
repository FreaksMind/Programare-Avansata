Problem: Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes Person, Company.
    Both classes should implement the interface java.util.Comparable. The natural order of the objects will be given by their names.
    Create the interface Node that defines the method used to obtain the name of a person or company. The classes above must implement this interface.
    Create a java.util.List containing node objects and print it on the screen.  
    
    
 Solution:
 I created the classes for persons and companies. In both classes I have a variable that stores the name and the compareTo and getName methods from the implemented interfaces. Both classes implements the Node and Comparable interfaces.
 The Node interface only contains a method which return a string.
