Problem: 
    Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Location, Road.
    The location and road types will be implemented as enums.
    Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters.
    Use the IDE features for code generation, such as generating getters and setters.
    The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes.
    Use the IDE features for code generation, for example (in NetBeans) press Alt+Ins or invoke the context menu, select "Insert Code" and then "toString()" (or simply start typing "toString" and then press Ctrl+Space).
    Create and print on the screen various objects of the two classes. 
    
 Solution:
  Am facut o clasa pentru fiecare element (Road, Location), dar si pentru tipurile acestora (Enum Class). In clasa Location am adaugat metodele si membrii conform cerintei si am dat override metodei toString(). 
  Aceeasi pasi i-am facut si pentru clasa Road, dupa asta in clasa Main, respectiv in metoda main am facut cateva obiecte de tip Road si Location.
