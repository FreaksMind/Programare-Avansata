Problem:

    Create a Maven project.
    Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Students and projects have names. Make sure the objects of these classes are comparable.
    Create the students and the projects described in the example. Use streams in order to easily create the objects.
    Put all the students in a LinkedList and print them sorted by their names.
    Put all the projects in a TreeSet and print them sorted by their names. 
    
    Solution:
    
    Am creat proiectul Maven, dupa am adaugat cele doua clase Student si Project, clase care implementeaza Comparable. In ambele clase am o variabila name cu getterul si setterul aferent, iar in Main am "construit" structurile cerute
